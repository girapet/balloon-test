  <p>A resident on Route 123 near Old Forest Road wants to erect a cell phone tower on their property.
    Due to citizen concerns, the town Zoning Board has ordered them to do a balloon test at two 
    different heights to let residents and homeowners know if they will be able to see it.</p>
  <p>This web app has a survey that collects your balloon observations.  It sends these to a common 
    database and provides a map to see the results.</p>
  <p>The survey will work on your phone even when it's not connected to the internet.  Observations you 
    collect will be stored until an internet connection becomes available.  They are preserved even if you 
    close your phone's web browser.</p>
  <p>The survey will ask for permission to use your phone's location and camera.  The location is 
    required for the survey to work.</p>
